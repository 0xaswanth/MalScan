# MalScan - Malware Hash Scanner Tool

**MalScan** is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to scan files and directories for malware using VirusTotal's extensive database. It computes file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) and checks them against VirusTotal for potential threats. If a file is not found in the VirusTotal database, it offers the option to upload the file for scanning.
